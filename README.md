# Casey City Council Election

A council election is happening in The City of Casey, Victoria, Australia. The candidates have released statements and questionnaire responses. I would like to compare these, in order to uncover potential voting blocs or alliances. 

But there are 89 candidates. Comparing each statement to all the others, to discover similarities, would be time-consuming. So I will leverage my programming and data analysis skills to make this process faster.

If time permits, I'd also like to analyse the candidates' Facebook pages, so I can see which candidates have tagged one another in posts. It would be good to have a graphical representation of these social connections.
