WARD (if applicable)	Quarters Ward
CANDIDATEâ€™S NAME (as on ballot paper)	BAIRD, Craig
"What is your vision for the municipality of the above Council? (maximum 50 words)
I want to see a trimmed-down Casey Council, which can keep rates low. We also need the
services to run smoothly and Council to focus on Roads, Rates and Rubbish. Casey Council,
after four years of administration, must now be transparent and accessible to residents and
rate-payers."
"What expertise or attributes do you have which would help you in undertaking the role of Councillor?
Provide details (maximum 50 words)
I am a competent and natural leader with many years' experience, in private business,
managing software teams. With a willingness to listen and no prior political experience, I bring
fresh eyes, and will be inclined to question some of the accepted but unhelpful norms at our
council."
